# Identification-of-Spectrum-Holes-using-ANN-model-fo-Cognitive-Radio-Applications-
In this project, we propose an Artificial Neural Network model which predicts the channel
capacity. This channel state information is analyzed by determining the bandwidth for
identifying the spectrum holes. It is observed that channel capacity predicted by the ANN
model can be considered as a decision making parameter to declare channel occupancy status.
The analysis made from the graphs show that a channel, which is not transmitting, would
have low channel capacity. Hence we can identify white spaces in a particular geographical
location.
Also, USRP B200 is used to obtain real time Signal To Noise ratio for FM channels to
determine Channel Capacity using Artificial Neural Network to estimate user status.
In this simulation we have successfully analyzed the performance of two neural network that
is feed forward Neural Network where feed forward based spectrum sensing algorithm in
cognitive radio network shows better performance.
